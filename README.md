# greenmap

Extract from [Greenmap.by](http://greenmap.by), it is the map the places and objects related to ecology and recycling. 

This mini project was made in 2017 in term of Treemap project (mapping of trees in urban regions of Belarus). Actually, the main issue was architecture of Greenmap, because it was built on proprietary badly documented platform that did not provide any tools and ways to get the data in clear machine-readable format.
